# ML_SatelliteImage_LandCover
In this python notebook, I present an end-to-end demonstration of land cover classification of an satellite image using convolutional neural networks. Please refer to accompanied pdf file for details.
The original satellite image file downloaded for this work is ~1.8GB, and the combined visual bands image is still over 700MB. Obviously I cannot deposit these images in GitHub. If anyone wants these images, please leave me a message here.
